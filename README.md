# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This is the mini project for my 5th semester examination.
In this Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Project Code, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI.The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle . "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage." and used a simple random forest classifier.
